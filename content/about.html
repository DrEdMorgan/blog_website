<p>Whether its making a simple map or running complex analyses on satellite data, students and researchers are often called upon to do some sort of geospatial analysis. 🗺</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a wealth of tools available to do this, think R, Python and QGIS.🔨</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a steep learning curve is often required to apply these tools, particularly as we don’t all have a strong background in coding, GIS or remote sensing.</p>
<p>The UQ Geospatial Analysis Community of Practice (sometimes UQGAC) tries to make this process a bit less painful, by sharing our experiences, skills and tricks in a friendly and inclusive environment.</p>
<p>👩‍💻 We run monthly skill sharing tutorial sessions where a member of the community teaches us something they have learned along the way.</p>
<p>This is usually on the last thursday of each month.<br />
See <a href="/upcoming-events/">upcoming events</a> for the next session.</p>
<p>And check out our <a href="/post/">blog</a> for previous tutorials.</p>
