<h2>Geospatial Analysis Community of Practice - The University of Queensland (UGSAC)</h2>
<p>Blurb</p>
<p>Unveil the new <strong>website</strong>!</p>
<p>Point of contact - Mitchel Rudge</p>
<p>As a community of practice website, the idea is that members of the community will be able to contribute posts to the UQGSAC blog. It is a good use of multiple programming skills (Git/GitHub, R, html, etc‚Ä¶) and the aim is to cover the main skills necessary across Git and R to empower community members to contribute material directly to the website instead of everything being funneled through a few website administrators.</p>

<h2>blogdown basics</h2>
<p><code>blogdown</code> is an R package that allows the creation of websites using R Markdown and Hugo, a static site generator. blogdown websites in R have been all the rage the last few years and you have probably seen many ‚ÄòHugo-Academic theme‚Äô personal websites - all built in R!</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/yihui-xie.html">short online book</a> on blogdown written by the developer, Yihui and others, and a nice, more recent <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/">article by Allison Hill</a> on starting your own blogdown website from scratch.</p>
<p>Also, see St√©phane‚Äôs tutorial for UQGSAC on creating a blogdown website.</p>
<p>This session focuses on how to go about <em>contributing</em> to a</p>
<p>The UQGSAC website is built using the anatole theme. There are many themes to choose from and if you know html/CSS you can even build your own theme.</p>
<p>So how do we go about contributing to a blogdown website?</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/u2pmTWUi0MXjyrMaVj/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>Good place to start is making sure you have installed the <code>blogdown</code> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In order for multiple people to contribute to the same website, the website is hosted on <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Netlify</strong>.</p>
<p>As the website is already set-up, we will be dealing with Git + GitHub and R + RStudio + Rmarkdown.</p>
</div>
<div id="git---what-is-it" class="section level2">
<h2>Git - what is it?</h2>
<p>A <strong>version control software</strong> (think track changes) useful for collaborating on and sharing code.</p>
<p>Git is the <em>software itself</em> that records changes to a set of files locally. There are several hosting platforms that are like online repositories (think Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) that work with Git: Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub to name a few.</p>
<p>These platforms not only allow for version control but also to collaborate, organize, and back up projects.</p>
<p>In this case, we will be using <strong>GitHub</strong> to access the website files, make some changes (i.e., add a post), and then incorporate those changes back to the website repository on GitHub which will automatically update the website itself. üôå</p>
<p>We will focus on contributing a post to an existing website repository on GitHub, but there are lots of fabulous and free resources online that go more into depth on Git.</p>
<p>If you need to be convinced to use Git for version control see this <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/">article</a> and <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/index.html">happy git with r</a> to git started both by Git/R guru Jenny Bryant.</p>
<p>See Dr Caitie Kuempel‚Äôs R Ladies Brisbane <a href="https://github.com/cdkuempel/getting_started_github">presentation</a> on getting started with GitHub in RStudio.</p>
<div id="git-terminology" class="section level3">
<h3>Git Terminology</h3>
<p><strong>Repository</strong> - where a project is stored in GitHub. Think of it like a folder holding all the relevant documents that you can verson control, view history, and add collaborators. The repository or repo holds all the relevant files for the website - most of which we will not touch.</p>
<p><strong>Commit</strong> - is one or more changes to a file or set of files that you are asking GitHub to keep track of.</p>
<p><strong>Push</strong> - sending your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub. Local changes updated on the GitHub website where other people can access.</p>
<p><strong>Pull</strong> - incorporating and merging changes. An edit on the remote repository on GitHub can be pulled to a local repository.</p>
<p><strong>Fork</strong> - A copy of another user‚Äôs repo on your account. This allows you to freely change a project without affecting the original upstream repo. You can keep your fork synced with changes in the original repo. - this is <em>fetching upstream</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Clone</strong> - a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of a website server like GitHub. Is still connected to the remote repo online and you can push/pull edits.</p>

<h2>How to create a post in blogdown</h2>
<p>Starting with Git and GitHub:</p>
<div id="fork-the-repo" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Fork the repo</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sign in with your GitHub account</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/geocommunity/website">geocommunity/website repo:</a></li>
<li>Press the <em>‚ÄòFork‚Äô</em> button at the top right.
<img src="images/Github-fork.png" alt="Screenshot of the ‚Äòfork‚Äô button on GitHub." /></li>
<li>A <em>forked</em> copy of the repo should now be visible in your GitHub account.
<img src="images/Github-forkedrepo.png" alt="Screenshot of a forked repo on GitHub." /></li>
</ul>
<p>The `YOU/REPO‚Äô is known as <strong>origin</strong> for your local repo.</p>
</div>
<div id="clone-the-repo-in-a-new-rstudio-project" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Clone the repo in a new RStudio project</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will need your GitHub credentials handy.</li>
<li>You can also set up RStudio so you do not need to input your GitHub credentials every time.</li>
</ul>
<p>From your forked repo, click on the green ‚ÄòCode‚Äô button and copy the link in the pop-up window.</p>
<p><strong>clone pic</strong></p>
<p>Next, in RStudio, go to File &gt; New Project. In the pop-up window, click the last option ‚ÄòVersion Control‚Äô and then ‚ÄòGit‚Äô. In the following window, paste the url you copied from your forked GitHub repo in the first box which will automatically input the name of the project.</p>
<p><strong>pic</strong></p>
<p>Conceptually, what we have done is:
<strong>JB fork clone pic</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have <em>cloned</em> the repository, let‚Äôs explore the file structure a little in the ‚ÄòFiles‚Äô tab in RStudio. It is NOT a very intuitively set-up even for intermediate users of R. For the purposes of creating a new post to add to the blog, we are mostly concerned with the <code>content/</code> directory that contains the <code>post/</code> sub-directory.</p>
<p>The rest of the files are the ‚Äòbackend‚Äô of the site using html, CSS, js, etc. to build the website. Have a look if you are curious but make changes at the risk of being ‚Äòthat person‚Äô to break the site! But don‚Äôt worry, since we are using Git version control all changes are tracked and reversible.</p>
<p>Now that we are somewhat familiar with the project structure. Let‚Äôs create a new post.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-new-post" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Create a new post</h3>
<p>In our new RStudio project housing our <em>forked</em> and <em>cloned</em> GitHub repo of the website:</p>
<p>Use <code>blogdown::new_post("New post name", ext = ".Rmd")</code> in the console to create a new post with a .Rmd extension. Alternatively, you can go to the ‚ÄòAddins‚Äô button under the menu and choose ‚ÄòNew Post‚Äô under the BLOGDOWN section and fill in the information in the pop-up window.</p>
<p><strong>pic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This will create a new page/post bundle folder or sub-directory within <code>post/</code> with the date and the name given in <code>new_post()</code> function. e.g., <code>post/2021-11-18-New-post-name</code>.</li>
<li>An index.Rmd file has been opened and only contains a YAML header (enclose by <code>---</code>) - more on that later. Do not change the name of the .Rmd file.</li>
<li>Each post gets its own bundle which is where your static post-specific files like images or data (.csv files etc.) used in your post should go.</li>
<li>Note that the ‚ÄúNew post name‚Äù will not only be the incorporated into the sub-directory name, but also the url to the post. Read: choose wisely and concise &gt; long descriptive name.</li>
<li>This ‚ÄúNew post name‚Äù will automatically be filled as the ‚ÄòTitle:‚Äô in the .Rmd YAML heading. If you want a longer, descriptive title - change it in the YAML heading.</li>
<li>It is recommend you use either <code>blogdown::new_post()</code> or the Addin to create a new post instead of manually creating a new file (File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown script)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we will stick with the .Rmd extension, but know there are a few file types:</p>
<p><strong>.md - markdown</strong>, cannot run code chunks<br />
<strong>.Rmd - R markdown</strong> -&gt; rendered to .html using Pandoc<br />
<strong>.Rmarkdown - also R markdown</strong> -&gt; compiled to .markdown documents</p>
<p>If you want more of this detailed stuff see: <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="commit-the-changes-i.e.-the-new-post" class="section level3">
<h3>4. <strong>Commit</strong> the changes i.e., the new post</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs commit our new post. You can add something like a line of text, or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you cloned the repo properly there should be a ‚ÄòGit‚Äô tab in the upper right hand window in RStudio where the ‚ÄòEnvironment‚Äô is. In the Git repo, there should be some files listed (i.e., <code>post/2021-11-23-New-post-name</code>) with different colored boxed under the ‚ÄòStatus‚Äô column.</li>
<li>Check the ‚ÄòStaged‚Äô box for the files you want to include in this commit.</li>
<li>Click the ‚ÄòCommit‚Äô button and a window will pop-up. In the bottom section, you will see the changes made to the file as additions (green) and deletions (red) - this is known as the <strong>diff</strong> in GitHub speak. For a new file, the whole thing will be green because it is all new.</li>
<li>In the ‚ÄòCommit message‚Äô box, add a concise but descriptive message of the changes like ‚ÄòAdded a new post bundle.‚Äô Once you are happy with everything (file staged, commit messages, etc.) click the ‚ÄòCommit‚Äô button.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>commit pic</strong></p>
<p>Some stuff will happen and if you see the line ‚Äô‚Äô then it‚Äôs all good and you‚Äôve made your first commit!</p>
<p>Knowing when and how often to commit is a bit of an art that comes with experience. In general, you want to commit changes that are related to a single problem and have a commit message that describes the why instead of the what which is recorded in the <strong>diff</strong>.</p>
<p>There is also a <code>History</code> button on the top left corner that will list all the commits with messages you have made and you can view the diff by clicking on a commit.</p>
<p>See more on committing and <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/git.html#commit-best-practices">best practices</a> from the R Rackages book.</p>
</div>
<div id="push-the-changes-to-github" class="section level3">
<h3>5.<strong>Push</strong> the changes to GitHub</h3>
<p>The changes and commits we have made are local, but we need to get them onto the GitHub repo and then the website. This is where we need to <strong>push</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Git window, you will see a blue down arrow for <strong>pull</strong>ing and a green up arrow for <strong>push</strong>ing. You will also see a message along the lines of ‚ÄòYour branch is ahead of ‚Äôorigin/main‚Äô by X commits‚Äô under those buttons.</p>
<p>For the purposes of contributing a post to a blogdown website, we will not worry about pulls and <em>fetching upstream</em> at all. This basically means keeping your <code>origin/master</code> repo synced with the original repo that you forked. If you stick to creating a new post bundle and <strong>only modifying files within the post bundles</strong> it should be okay. BUT, know that if you are using GitHub to work collaboratively staying current with the original repo is important and would use <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html">Happy Git with R</a> as your trusty guide.</p>
<p>So now we will <em>push</em> our commits from or local repo to our remote ‚Äòorigin/master‚Äô repo on GitHub. If you see <code>HEAD -&gt; main</code> then all good.</p>
<p><strong>pic</strong></p>
<p>Now if you go back to your GitHub account and forked repo online, you should see the changes you made locally are now in the remote online repo and your commit message.</p>
<p><strong>pic</strong></p>
<p>In general, you should <strong>commit</strong> often and then <strong>push</strong> now and then.</p>
</div>
<div id="serve-the-site" class="section level3">
<h3>5. Serve the site</h3>
<p>In the console, run <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code>. Alternatively, can click on RStudio ‚ÄòAddins‚Äô and select ‚ÄòServe Site‚Äô. Be patient, but what happens?</p>
<p><strong>served site pic</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html#serve-site">blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serving the site did the following:
1. Started a local Hugo server to help you preview your website, and
2. Knitted a sample <code>.Rmd</code> post to an <code>.html</code> page. You can see this from the progress message that printed to your console: <code>Rendering content/english/post/2021-11-23-creating-a-post/index.Rmd... Done</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also view the locally served website in a browser by clicking on the ‚ÄúShow in new window‚Äù button at the top left of the RStudio View pane to the right of the broom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let‚Äôs introduce an important and helpful technology that you just used: LiveReload. Serving your site uses LiveReload, which means your website4 will be automatically rebuilt and reloaded in your web browser5 when you modify any source file of your website and save it. Basically, once you launch the website in a web browser, you do not need to rebuild it explicitly anymore. All you need to do is edit the source files, such as R Markdown documents, and save them. There is no need to click any buttons or run any commands. LiveReload is implemented via blogdown::serve_site() and Hugo, and you will only need to use it once per work session.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To stop serving the site locally run <code>blogdown::stop_server()</code> in the console.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-your-content" class="section level3">
<h3>6. Create your content</h3>
<p>Once the website is set-up, forked, and cloned‚Ä¶ you can get away with creating a new post with minimal coding. The main thing you will need to use is:</p>
<div id="r-markdown" class="section level4">
<h4>R Markdown</h4>
<p>This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML documents that we can incorporate into the website. For more details on using R Markdown see <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com" class="uri">http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com</a>.</p>
<p>When you click the <strong>Knit</strong> button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. For a website post, knitting is not as important because we can serve our site locally (which automatically knits anything new) and view the changes.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs add some information about R Markdown:</p>
<div id="yaml-header" class="section level5">
<h5>YAML header</h5>
<p>The YAML, or Yet Another Markdown Language, header at the top of the .Rmd is set between <code>---</code> tags. Here is where information like the Title, Date, Author of the document go.</p>
</div>
<div id="formatting" class="section level5">
<h5>Formatting</h5>
<p>Can <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italicize</em> text.</p>
<p>Headings:</p>
<p>Can specify headings using # marks. The number of has symbols corresponds to the level of the header (2 hashs = level 2 header)</p>
<p>This will also create a structure outline of your document you can navigate either by using the ‚ÄòFormatting‚Äô button at the bottom of the .Rmd or the right most button in the top right of the .Rmd.</p>
<p>Make lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>one</li>
<li>two</li>
<li>three
<ul>
<li>full indent for sub-bullet</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Ordered lists:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>lists</li>
<li>need spaces</li>
<li>before and after</li>
</ol>
<p>For a return to start a new line, leave <strong>two spaces</strong> at the end of the line.<br />
Like this.</p>
</div>
<div id="including-code" class="section level5">
<h5>Including code</h5>
<p>You can embed an R code chunk like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(cars)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00</code></pre>
<p>There is also inline code: The mean of speed in the cars data set is 15.4.</p>
</div>
<div id="include-mathematical-notation" class="section level5">
<h5>Include mathematical notation</h5>
<p>To enter equations like a code chunk, use two <code>$</code> on separate lines surrounding your equations.</p>
<p>Put two <code>\</code> after a line for a full return.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y = mx + \beta\\
E = mc^2
\]</span></p>
<p>You can also use inline math notation by sandwiching it between <code>$</code> <strong>without spaces</strong>. Like so <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 0.2566\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="including-plots" class="section level5">
<h5>Including Plots</h5>
<p>You can also embed plots, for example:</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="chunk-options" class="section level5">
<h5>Chunk options</h5>
<p>Chunks are the gray areas in the .Rmd file where you can add code that will be run. These are defined by three backticks (not a single quote, the key to the left of the 1). You can insert R code chunks but also in other languages! See the green ‚ÄòInsert‚Äô code chunk button to see different options. An R code chunk will have the an <code>{r  }</code> after the opening backticks.</p>
<p>The keyboard short cut to add an R code chunk is <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Alt</code> + <code>I</code></p>
<p>You can also set options in the {} of a chunk like hide the code chunk (echo = FALSE), suppress warnings (warnings = FALSE), and cache the chunk (cache = TRUE) if you have something that takes a while to run.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs set <code>echo = FALSE</code> for our plot chunk above. We are only interested in seeing the plot, not the code that produces the plot.</p>
<p>You</p>

<ul>
<li>RStudio - <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html</a></li>
<li>R Markdown Cookbook - <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It is also a good idea to name your chunks as chunks are included in the document outline. Chunks <strong>cannot</strong> have the same error - you will get an error.</p>
</div>
<div id="insert-objects" class="section level5">
<h5>Insert objects</h5>
<p>You can add pictures, weblinks, and GIFs in R Markdown. They all follow the similar hyperlink formats.</p>
<p>For a hyperlink to a website you put the word you want to hyperlink in square brackets <code>[]</code> followed immediately (no spaces or characters) by round parentheses <code>()</code>. E.g. <code>[GitHub](www.github.com)</code></p>
<p>To insert an image or gif from a website you add a <code>!</code> before the square brackets like so: <code>![description](https://media.giphy.com/media/u2pmTWUi0MXjyrMaVj/giphy.gif)</code></p>
<p>test: <img src="https://happygitwithr.com/img/fork-triangle-happy.png" alt="happy git" /></p>
<p>Note: The link must end in the appropriate file extension to work.</p>
<p>You can also insert pictures using the RStudio ‚ÄòAddins‚Äô &gt; ‚ÄòInsert Image‚Äô and uploading an image saved on your computer with a few other options like alt text. This will result in the same hyperlink code as inserting an image, but with a <em>relative path</em> instead of the url.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/ResBazQld2021.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ResBaz QLD 2021 event poster</p>
</div>
<p>You can also save files (like images, html presentations) in your post bundle to link using <em>relative paths</em> on your own.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="pull-request" class="section level3">
<h3>Pull Request</h3>
<p>Okay, so as you were creating the content of your post you should have been <strong>committing</strong> regularly and then <strong>pushing</strong> less regularly, right?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say we are finished with our beautiful post and read to incorporate it into the original upstream repo <code>geocommunity/blog_website</code> that we forked from. Remember, when we <strong>push</strong> we are pushing the commits we made locally on our computer to our <code>YOU/blog_website</code> repo that we <strong>forked</strong> from the original repo.</p>
<p>Because we are not owner/developers of the upstream <code>geocommunity/blog_website</code> repo we need to submit a <strong>pull request</strong> to submit our new blog post for acceptance into the upstream repo.</p>
<ul>
<li>On your <code>YOU/blog_website</code> repo in your GitHub account, click on <code>Pull requests</code>.</li>
<li>On the right of the screen, there should be a green <code>New pull request</code> button. This will take to you a ‚ÄòComparing changes‚Äô window outlining the files and changes you have made. This will alert you to any merge conflicts with the original upstream repo. Again, sticking to creating a new post bundle/content should avoid any merge conflicts.</li>
<li>Click the green <code>Create pull request</code> button on the right. This will take you to a ‚ÄòOpen a pull request‚Äô window that will have your last commit and space to add a larger message with your pull request or <strong>PR</strong>.</li>
<li>Once you are happy, click the green `` button at the end and wait for approval. You can have a bit of a conversation to hash out any issues as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations - now you have submitted your blog post to a blogdown site!</p>
